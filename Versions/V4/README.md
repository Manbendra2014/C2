## 1. Client Modifications

The following modifications to the **client** reflect enhancements made from its previous version , **Version 3**.
| Change Type | Description |

| **Updated** | Enhanced handling for executing PowerShell scripts. Now, PowerShell scripts are executed in a secure, temporary environment using `tempfile` for better management of script execution and file cleanup. |
| **Added**   | Improved script execution feedback, including success or failure notifications directly sent to the server. |
| **Updated** | Error handling during command execution is more robust, with detailed exception handling to ensure the client can gracefully handle unexpected conditions. |
| **Updated** | The structure of the command processing loop has been refined for better readability and performance, making it easier to maintain. |
| **Updated** | PowerShell execution policies are managed more securely to prevent unauthorized script execution. |

## 2. Server Modifications

The following modifications to the **server** reflect enhancements made from its previous version , **Version 3**.
| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Added**   | Session management system added to handle multiple clients concurrently. Each client session is now managed independently, allowing better multi-client support. |
| **Updated** | The server can now handle multiple client connections simultaneously using threading, improving scalability and performance. |
| **Updated** | Directory structure management has been refined to ensure that user data is organized by session, making it easier to track individual client sessions. |
